# Day One Dev Kit (Preview)

Most side projects don’t fail because of bad code.

They fail before the first real feature.

Developers get stuck choosing:
- what to build first
- how to structure the project
- what actually matters on day one

This small kit exists for one reason:

**To help you move from “idea” to your first concrete feature.**

No frameworks.  
No tutorials.  
No long explanations.

Just a simple way to think clearly before you start coding.

## What this preview gives you

- A reduced checklist to define your first feature
- A clear way to avoid starting from a blank folder
- Direction without overplanning

If this helps you move forward, the full version goes deeper.
